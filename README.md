# Designing Airfare calendar using Essential JS2 Scheduler

The Airfare Calendar example has been created by making use of our [quick start](https://github.com/syncfusion/ej2-quickstart.git) project with JS2 Scheduler component.

## How to run this application?

To run this application, you need to first clone the `ej2-schedule-airfarecalendar` repository and then navigate to its appropriate path where it has been located in your system.

To do so, open the command prompt and run the below commands one after the other.

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionSamples/ej2-schedule-airfarecalendar airfare
cd airfare
```

## Installing

Once done with downloading, next you need to install the necessay packages required to run this application locally. The `npm install` command will install all the needed JS2 packages into your current project and to do so, run the below command.

```
npm install
```

## Running

Finally, you can now use the below `npm` script to run the web application.

```
npm start
```

As this application is configured with `browser-sync`, therefore it will serve the web application directly in your default browser.
